The COVID 19 pandemic has caused major changes to the world and the way we live. It has also been one of toughest of times for the NHS, therefore I wanted to investigate the impacts of the pandemic through exploratory data analysis.
Created a dashboard on data from the Public Health England throughs Pandas library as well as Ipywidgets. The creation of the dashboard involved utilising the API for PHE to pull data, wrangle and process the data as well creating interactive functions and visualisations.
